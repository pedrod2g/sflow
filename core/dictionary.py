"""Personal vocabulary dictionary. Fed to Whisper as `prompt=` hint.

Whisper uses the prompt as vocabulary bias — boosts recognition of proper
nouns, jargon, acronyms, etc. The `prompt` is NOT prepended to the output.

File format: plain text, one term or phrase per line, # comments allowed.
Max ~224 tokens is Whisper's hard limit — keep concise.
